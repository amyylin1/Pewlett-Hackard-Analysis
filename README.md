# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


##  1. Overview of the analysis:

The analysis aims to make a smooth transition for the company from the high volume of retirements.   To accomplish this, we will determine the following:

- the number of retiring employees per title;
- identify employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 


## 2. Results:

- The title "Senior Engineer" has the highest retiring count.
- The title "Senior Staff" has the second highest retiring count.
- The title "Manager" has the lowest retiring count.

## 3. Summary:

The number of retired employees (72,458) is much higher than the count of people eligible for mentorship (1,499).  At a minimum, at least 70% of roles will need to fill as the "silver tsunami" retires.  However, looking at the current workforce, there aren't enough people to fill vacancies, let alone people with the right qualifications and training.
